üß† Results

The YOLOv8-based Enhanced Visual Recognition System was successfully implemented for object and human detection. The model effectively identified and localized multiple objects and people in real-time using bounding boxes and confidence scores, demonstrating its precision and robustness.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Human Detection Results

In the classroom test image, the YOLOv8 model accurately detected multiple individuals present in the frame. Each person was enclosed within a blue bounding box labeled ‚Äúperson‚Äù along with their respective confidence scores ranging from 0.83 to 0.88.
This confirms the system‚Äôs ability to detect humans in dynamic environments with varying lighting and crowd density.
The detection process efficiently handled multiple targets simultaneously, validating the real-time multi-object tracking capability of YOLOv8.

Example Output:

Detected Objects: 7 persons

Average Confidence: 0.85

Detection Speed: ~30 FPS (frames per second)

Model Used: YOLOv8n (Nano version for real-time performance)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Object Detection Example (Classification & Detection)

The YOLOv8 model also demonstrated high accuracy in object classification and detection.
In the test image below, the system correctly recognized a cat with high confidence. The classification task achieved a 0.92 confidence score, while the detection task enclosed the cat within a bounding box at 0.91 confidence, highlighting YOLOv8‚Äôs capability to both identify and localize objects precisely.

Example Output:

Detected Object: Cat

Classification Confidence: 0.92

Detection Confidence: 0.91

Model Used: YOLOv8s (Small version for balanced accuracy & speed)
